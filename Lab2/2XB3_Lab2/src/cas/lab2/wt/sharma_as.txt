Design Decisions/Assumptions:

Each language has their own implementation of ".random()". It was interesting to know that 
in Java it only generates a value between 0.0 and 1.0. It was also interesting to see
that we could do something similar to "type-casting" in Java when we do " i + (int) EXPRESSION ".

I think that the design decisions were well explained and no assumptions were made. The lab was
clear and straight forward.
