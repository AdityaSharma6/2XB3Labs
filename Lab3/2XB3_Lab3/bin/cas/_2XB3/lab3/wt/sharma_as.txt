Design Decisions/Assumptions:

I've wondered why methods always have the word "public" before it, now it makes a lot more sense.
It defines the boundary of use between programs. For example: If it has the word "public", it 
means that other programs/classes defined in other files can use it. If it doesn't, then they can't.

I think that the design decisions were well explained and no assumptions were made. The lab was
clear and straight forward.
